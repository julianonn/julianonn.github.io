I'm a rising 2nd year computer science _(probably)_ PhD student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I'm advised by [Dr. Rahul Chatterjee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chatterjee/) in the [MadS&P](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/) (Security & Privacy) research group. 

I'm interested in software security for everyday people, including accessible cybersecurity,  mitigations for tech-facilitated abuse, and digital evidence in family law. I volunteer at the [Madison Tech Clinic](https://techclinic.cs.wisc.edu/) providing trauma-informed, cybersecurity assistance to survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) around Wisconsin.

Before UW–Madison, I did my undergrad in math and computer science at Georgetown University (and became a tech policy wonk by osmosis). I was involved with GU's [Tech & Society Initiative](https://techandsociety.georgetown.edu/) as a [Fritz Fellow](https://techandsociety.georgetown.edu/projects/fritz-family-fellows-program/). I had the privilege of working with [Dr. Elissa Redmiles](https://elissaredmiles.com/), the [Massive Data Institute](https://mdi.georgetown.edu/), and Georgetown Law's [Center on Privacy & Technology](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/privacy-technology-center/) auditing forensic DNA analysis software systems. I also interned with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, where I learned an _enormous_ amount about how to make government and its digital systems work better for the people they serve.

I spend way too much of my free time on the NYT Cooking site and not nearly enough of it implementing my saved recipes. I'm nebulously training for a half-marathon.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
