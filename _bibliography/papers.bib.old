    When survivors of technology-facilitated abuse suspect unauthorized access to their online accounts, they (and advocates supporting them) 
    often rely on built-in security interfaces, such as trusted device lists, to identify account compromise. However, these interfaces typically 
    offer limited or ambiguous details about past access and security-critical events. Under right-of-access provisions in data protection laws, 
    users can request structured exports of their personal data from online services. In this study, we explore whether and how data exports can 
    supplement security interfaces to support compromise investigations, particularly in interpersonal threat contexts. We simulate four types of 
    interpersonal account compromise attacks across six popular platforms, analyze the resulting data exports and user interfaces, and map data 
    export contents to specific attack steps — such as authentication and in-account activity. Our findings show that data exports consistently 
    contain more granular login histories and richer device/network identifiers than interfaces. Some even link security-relevant actions to specific
    devices, offering forensic value for identifying compromise. We conclude by discussing the practical challenges of deploying 
    data exports in technology abuse intervention.
